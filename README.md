# NeuroCom

NeuroCom is an open-source full stack real time messaging and file sharing social media platform built with Django, Django Rest Framework, React, Postgresql, Redis, and Websockets.
This is a solo project that I’ve been developing for over the past 5–6 months, and its also my first large scale Django and React application.

## Features:
- Real time messaging (Websocket based)

- Direct messages and group chatrooms

- Multiple channels for every chatroom

- Friend system (send/cancel/accept/decline requests)

- Block/unblock users

- File uploads (media/file sharing in messages & profile picture upload)

- Real time notifications

- User settings (mute notifications, dark/light mode, etc.)

- Chatroom invitations

- Voice chatting (will be added in the future updates).

so this project was both my learning ground and proof of concept for building full-stack applications.
I built NeuroCom from scratch while learning Django and React, and through this project I gained lots of experience with:

- Full stack development

- Real time architecture

- Rest api design

- WebSockets and asynchronous programming

- react component based frontend development

- Authentication & authorization flows

- Redis pub/sub and background tasks


## Tech stack:
- Frontend: React, TypeScript, Vite

- Backend: Django, Django REST Framework, Channels (websockets)

- Database: PostgreSQL

- Real time Layer: Redis + Django Channels
